3. From Alibaba:

- **FaaS cold start trace dataset collected from Alibaba**: FaaSNet is the first system that provides an end-to-end, integrated solution for FaaS-optimized container runtime provisioning. FaaSNet uses lightweight, decentralized, and adaptive Function Trees (FTs) to avoid major platform bottlenecks. Continue Reading -> https://github.com/mason-leap-lab/FaaSNet

- Alibaba Cluster Trace Program:
The Alibaba Cluster Trace Program is published by Alibaba Group. By providing cluster trace from real production, the program helps the researchers, students and people who are interested in the field to get better understanding of the characterastics of modern internet data centers (IDC's) and the workloads.....Continue Reading -> https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata
